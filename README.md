[Python Packages Used: ‘PyPDF2’, ‘Regular Expression’, ‘Fitz’, ‘Tabula’ & ‘Bert -Summarizer’]

Marketing and Financial Reports generated are usually highly comprehensive. As a result of this, it becomes really difficult to go through the entire report to know the key insights in a short span of time. Hence, creating a summarization tool will help in efficiently getting the key insights for understanding the gist of the report in a short span of time. It will also be beneficial for people not well-versed with the technical jargon, but looking to get some key market insights from a company’s official annual reports.
